You can pan, zoom, etc., but they do not allow you to do many other things you might want to do like get information about a point or line, to click on one figure to update another one, etc. We are going to work our towards doing that.\n\nFirst, we need a mental model of how an interactive figure works. A figure is shown in a graphic window, and that window can generate an *event*. That event may be something like a mouse-click, a key-press, or hover over, entering or leaving a figure, etc. Each of these events can be connected to a *callback* function which will be run with the event as an argument when an event occurs. This function is responsible for doing the interactive features you want.\n\nSo, the key idea we need to develop here is what events can we attach callback functions to, and how do we write callback functions to make the interactive features we want. We will focus exclusively on matplotlib because it allows us to write the callback functions in Python. There are several web-based tools for making interactive graphics that work in HTML files. I find these much more difficult to use, and they are much more limited because they are typically powered by javascript, which has limited ability to interact with files on your hard drive.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Your first event - Mouse clicking\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A [MouseEvent](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/api/backend_bases_api.html#matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent) is triggered when a mouse button is pressed on a matplotlib figure.
